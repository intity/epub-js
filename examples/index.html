                    <li><a href="spreads.html">Spreads</a>
                        <p>Display an ebook two pages at a time. Also includes code to provide table-of-contents in a
                            select
                            object above the rendered ebook. Sections of the ebook are displayed separately so if a
                            section
                            has a single page or an odd number of pages it will display with a blank page on the right.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="archived.html">Archived</a>
                        <p>Display ebook from an XXXX.epub file rather than an unzipped folder. This may be
                            substantially
                            slower for large ebooks.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="scrolled.html">Scrolled Doc</a>
                        <p>Displays each "section" or "chapter" of the ebook in its entirety as a single page of
                            variable
                            height that you can scroll up and down. Includes code to provide navigation links above and
                            below the rendered section to go to the previous or next section.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="continuous-spreads.html">Spreads Continuous</a>
                        <p>The view is the same as (1) above except that the entire document is rendered at once without
                            breaks so if a section has one page, the next section is shown beginning on the
                            right-hand-page
                            rather than a blank page. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="continuous-scrolled.html">Scrolled Continuous</a>
                        <p>The view is the same as (3) except the entire ebook is rendered in the browser at once so
                            there
                            are no navigation links above and below each chapter. This version may take longer to render
                            and
                            uses more memory since the whole ebook is loaded into memory. This version has no links to
                            navigate or jump between chapters.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="swipe.html">Swipe</a>
                        <p>This example includes a function in the script to link "swipe" events on touchscreens,
                            particularly mobile devices, to navigate forward and back. Note that swipes do not work in
                            Chrome Desktop even if you turn on device emulation in the "inspect" toolbar. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="input.html">Open from File</a>
                        <p>Allows you to select an epub file from your local computer that gets rendered in the browser.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="renderless.html">Renderless</a>
                        <p>The name for this example is misleading since the book certainly does render. What's unique
                            in
                            this example is that the book's table of contents is read in and a list of sections in
                            developed, then each section is rendered as it is called for by a
                            <code>section.render()</code>
                            call, but there's no master <code>book.renderTo()</code> call. Functionlly this seems
                            exactly
                            the same as (1) and (3).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="hooks.html">Hooks</a>
                        <p>This example shows how to insert external javascript and external css files into a book after
                            the
                            book has been loaded into memory. This might, for example, allow you to override internal
                            css
                            from the ebook to change fonts and text-size by either replacing a css file from the ebook
                            or
                            calling a javascript that gets added to the inside of the ebook such as adding jQuery inside
                            the
                            ebook. For example: this could be used to have + and - buttons that increase or decrease the
                            font-size in the ebook. When the + or - button is pressed it could call to insert and
                            execute a
                            script to replace the font-size of paragraph elements with one slightly larger or smaller.
                            This
                            example doesn't actually implement any such thing, it just shows how to insert the code, or
                            insert a css file.</p>
                        <p>You can't just run a script on the outer page to change things inside the rendered ebook
                            because
                            the ebook is rendered inside an iframe. This mechanism lets you inject things into the
                            iframe
                            and run them after the book is rendered.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="highlights.html">Highlights</a>
                        <p>Adds the ability to highlight text in the ebook. This version provides no mechanism for
                            saving
                            highlights after the browser is closed. It is an example of capability rather than a working
                            implementation. It works as follows: When a section of text is selected a
                            <code>rendition.on("selected"...)</code> function notes the location of the beginning and
                            ending of the
                            selected text. Two things happen. The code adds a new element to the outer page in a list at
                            the
                            bottom describing the selection and providing a "remove" link. The code also paints a yellow
                            block in an SVG overlay to highlight the selected text. Unfortunately as of 5/14/2019 the
                            remove
                            link does remove the yellow overlay from the highlighted text but, does not remove the
                            annotation from the list at the bottom of the page.
